Bilateral Renal Agenesis is the absence of both kidneys at birth.  It is a genetic disorder characterized by a failure of the kidneys to develop in a fetus. This absence of kidneys causes a deficiency of amniotic fluid (Oligohydramnios) in a pregnant woman. Normally, the amniotic fluid acts as a cushion for the developing fetus. When there is an insufficient amount of this fluid, compression of the fetus may occur resulting in further malformations of the baby. Bilateral renal agenesis is found in male infants more frequently than females.  It tends to occur in the children of parents having kidney abnormalities.  It is a very rare disorder. Treatment of bilateral renal agenesis is symptomatic and supportive.
