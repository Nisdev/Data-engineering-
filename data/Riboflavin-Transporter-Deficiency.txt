Riboflavin transporter deficiency is believed to affect females and males in equal numbers. The exact number of people who have this disorder is unknown. As of November 2017, about 165 affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature or to the Cure RTD Registry. Rare disorders like riboflavin transporter deficiency often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population. Researchers believe that these disorders are underdiagnosed; one estimate suggests that at least 1 in 1,000,000 people in the general population have riboflavin transporter deficiency.
