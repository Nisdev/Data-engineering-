Hereditary ataxias affect males and females in equal numbers. It is estimated that 150,000 people in the United States are affected by, or at risk for, hereditary ataxia. There is variation among the specific forms of hereditary ataxia as to when they typically first appear. Some ataxias are more common in certain ethnic groups.  For example, SCA3 is more common in the Portuguese population, SCA10 is more common in the Mexican population, and DRPLA is more common in Japan.
