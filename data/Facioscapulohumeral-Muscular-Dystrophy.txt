FSHD appears to affect males and females in relatively equal numbers. The estimated prevalence is between four and ten per 100,000 people. There are a number of genetic neuromuscular diseases that may be characterized by muscle weakness of varying severity, muscle atrophy, and associated symptoms that may be similar to those that may occur with FSHD. These include myofibrillar myopathy, inclusion body myositis, including inclusion body myopathy 2 (IBM2), mitochondrial myopathies, congenital myopathies and polymyositis. These conditions typically have characteristic features that may differentiate them from FSHD.
