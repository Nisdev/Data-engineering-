Ogilvie syndrome is believed to affect males and females in equal numbers, although one large study suggested that males may be affected more often than females. Ogilvie syndrome can potentially affect individuals of any age, but most often occurs in late middle age (mean age in the 60s). The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is unknown. Because cases can go unrecognized and resolve spontaneously, determining the true frequency of the disorder is the general population is difficult. Ogilvie syndrome generally develops in hospitalized or institutionalized individuals following an acute illness or surgery.
