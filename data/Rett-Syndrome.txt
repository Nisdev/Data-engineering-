Rett syndrome occurs almost exclusively in girls. The incidence of Rett syndrome in the United States is estimated to be 1 in 10,000 girls by age 12. Cases of Rett syndrome can go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the disorderâ€™s true frequency in the general population. Rett syndrome is the second most common cause of severe intellectual disability after Down syndrome.
