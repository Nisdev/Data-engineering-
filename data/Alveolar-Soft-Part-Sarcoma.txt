Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare, slow growing soft tissue tumor of an unclear cause. 
It is among the least common sarcomas, representing 0.2-1 percent of large studies of soft tissue sarcomas. ASPS is characterized by a painless mass that most commonly arises in the leg or buttock, with a particular affinity to travel to the lungs as multiple nodules, presumably while the sarcoma itself is still small. This disorder is very rare because it involves a specific breaking and joining event between two chromosomes, called an “unbalanced translocation”. This finding is observed in essentially all people with ASPS examined so far. This finding cannot be passed on to children, however, as the finding occurs only in the tumor cells, not in the normal cells. In addition, there are no families in which multiple family members have the disorder. ASPS tends to occur more often in younger individuals, specifically adolescents and young adults. ASPS tends to affect younger people, especially those between 15 and 35 years of age. It is rare in children under 5 or in adults over 50. Women outnumber men, especially under age 25. There appears to be no link of this tumor to a particular ethnicity. ASPS accounts for about 0.2-1% of all soft tissue sarcomas. In turn, soft tissue sarcomas account for approximately 1% of all cancers.
