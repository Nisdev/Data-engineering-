Chromosome 10, distal trisomy 10q is an extremely rare but well-defined chromosomal disorder that appears to affect males and females at about the same rate. More than 35 cases have been reported in the medical literature since the disorder was originally described in 1974 (J.J. Yunis). Many of the symptoms and physical features associated with the disorder are apparent at birth (congenital).
