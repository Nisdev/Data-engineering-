Trigeminal neuralgia affects females slightly more often than males. Although the exact incidence is unknown, approximately 10,000-15,000 new cases occur each year in the United States. The disorder most frequently affects individuals more than 50 years of age. However, cases can occur in younger adults as well. In younger individuals, the cause is often idiopathic, but when compared to older adult cases  are more likely to be caused by damage to the central nervous system as in individuals with multiple sclerosis. Although extremely rare, TN can occur in children.
