Smith-Magenis syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence is estimated to be 1 in 15,000-25,000 people in the general population in the United States. However, cases may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of SMS in the general population. SMS has been reported throughout the world and in all ethnic groups.
