Soft tissue sarcomas affect men and women and individuals of any age and every racial and ethnic group. This is a large group of tumors, but overall, they are still classified as rare disorders. Estimates to their frequency varies. The American Cancer Society estimates that soft tissue sarcomas account for about 2% of all cancers in the United States. However, because rare diseases often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, determining their true frequency in the general population is difficult.
