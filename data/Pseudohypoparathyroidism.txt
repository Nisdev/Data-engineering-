Pseudohypoparathyroidism is a hereditary disorder characterized by an inadequate response to the parathyroid hormone, although the hormone is present in normal amounts. This inadequate response affects bone growth in individuals with Pseudohypoparathyroidism. Affected individuals may also experience headaches, unusual sensations, weakness, easy fatigue, lack of energy, blurred vision, and/or abnormal sensitivity (hypersensitivity) to light. Additional symptoms and findings may include stiffness or cramps in the arms and/or legs, palpitations, and/or abdominal pain. In addition, individuals with Pseudohypoparathyroidism may have an abnormally round face, thick short stature, unusually short fourth fingers, and mental retardation. Hormonal and calcium replacement therapy is often helpful, but the lack of growth may persist. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is characterized by short stature, a round face, short neck, and shortened bones in the hands and feet.  Intelligence usually ranges from low normal to mentally retarded.  Headaches, weakness, tiring easily, lethargy, cataracts and blurred vision or hypersensitivity to light may also be present.  During childhood, seizures may occur.  Teeth with underdeveloped enamel tend to erupt later than normal during infancy.  Levels of calcium in the blood are usually low, while phosphate and the parathyroid hormone are elevated.  Patients with Pseudohypoparathyroidism can lead a normal life. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is a rare disorder that affects more than twice as many females than males. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is treated with the vitamin compound 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D, which promotes reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys.
