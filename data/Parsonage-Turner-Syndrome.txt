PTS affects males more often than females. The incidence of the disorder is based upon available population studies and is estimated to be approximately 1.64 to 3.00 people per every 100,000 individuals in the general population per year. However, cases of PTS may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population. The condition develops most often in young to middle-aged adults, but has been reported in young children and the elderly. Additional conditions or disorders that can cause symptoms similar to those seen in PTS include bursitis, rotator cuff injury or disease, calcific tendonitis, impingement syndromes, Guillain-Barre syndrome, cervical disc disease, cervical radiculopathy, mononeuritis monoplex, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrigâ€™s disease), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, polymyalgica rheumatica, thoracic outlet syndrome, and brachial plexus injury secondary to cancer (neoplastic brachial plexopathy). Adhesive capsulitis, which can develop as a complication of PTS, can develop for other reasons as well. NORD has individual reports on some of these disorders and a general report on peripheral neuropathy.
