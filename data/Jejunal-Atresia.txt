Jejunal Atresia is a rare genetic disorder. Patients with this disorder are born with a partial absence of the fold of the stomach membrane that connects the small intestine to the back wall of the abdomen. As a result, one of the three portions of the small intestine (the jejunal) twists around one of the arteries of the colon called the marginal artery and causes a blockage (atresia). Symptoms in individuals with this disorder include vomiting, a swollen abdomen, and constipation. Jejunal Atresia may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, or it may  occur sporadically with no known cause.  Human traits, including the classic  genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one  received from the father and one from the mother.  In recessive disorders,  the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective  gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one  normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for  the disease, but usually will not show symptoms.  The risk of transmitting  the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a  recessive disorder, is 25 percent.  Fifty percent of their children risk  being carriers of the disease, but generally will not show symptoms of the  disorder.  Twenty-five percent of their children may receive both normal  genes, one from each parent, and will be genetically normal (for that particular trait).  The risk is the  same for each pregnancy. Jejunal Atresia is a very rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  There have been approximately 57 cases reported in the medical literature.
