Estimates of the incidence and prevalence of primary hyperparathyroidism in the Western world varies. Most of people with the disorder, more 80% in the Western world, do not have any symptoms (asymptomatic). Individuals with symptoms, particularly severe symptoms, are a rarer occurrence in developed countries. Primary hyperthyroidism can occur at any age, but is most likely to affect individuals over 50. The incidence is highest among individuals of African-American heritage, followed by Caucasians. Women are affected about three times more often than men. According to one estimate, about 100,000 people in the United States develop primary hyperparathyroidism each year.
