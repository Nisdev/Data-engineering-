WNT4 deficiency is an extremely rare disorder that affects females. The exact incidence of the disorder is unknown and it has only been identified in several women worldwide. Researchers believe that cases of WNT4 deficiency may often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the disorderâ€™s true frequency in the general population. WNT4 deficiency is present at birth (congenital), but can go unidentified until adolescence.
