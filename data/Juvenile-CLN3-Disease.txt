Juvenile CLN3 disease affects males and females in equal numbers. In the United States, juvenile CLN3 disease along with the other forms of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, occurs in approximately three in 100,000 births. It can occur with greater frequency in families of Northern European Scandinavian ancestry; in particular, those of Swedish heritage. It is thought to occur in one in 25,000 infants in northern Europe. Juvenile CLN3 disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders affecting children.
