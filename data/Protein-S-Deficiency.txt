PROS1 Protein S deficiency is a rare disorder that affects both men and women. The exact prevalence the common form of protein S deficiency (the number of people who have the disorder in a given population) and incidence (new cases identified each year) of the disorder overall is unknown. Severe protein S deficiency is an extremely rare disorder and often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed making it difficult to determine its frequency in the general population.
