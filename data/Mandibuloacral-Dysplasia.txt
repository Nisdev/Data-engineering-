Approximately 40 cases of mandibuloacral dysplasia have been reported in the medical literature. Fewer than 10 cases of mandibuloacral dysplasia type B have been reported in the medical literature. Many cases of the disorder most likely go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of mandibuloacral dysplasia in the general population.
