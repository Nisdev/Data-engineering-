Warm antibody hemolytic anemia affects males and females in equal numbers. Autoimmune hemolytic anemias as a group are estimated to affect 1-3 people per 100,000 in the general population. People of any age, including children, may develop warm antibody hemolytic anemia, but it is more common among adults with a peak incidence between 50-70 years.
