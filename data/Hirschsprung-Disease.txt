Hirschsprung disease affects males 3 to 4 times more often than females, although long-segment HSCR has a gender ratio of 1:1. The disorder occurs in approximately one in 5,000 live births. It is usually apparent shortly after birth, but may present in older children and adults. Hirschsprung disease should be considered in people with a history of severe constipation.
