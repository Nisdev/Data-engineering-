Granuloma annulare is a chronic degenerative skin disorder. The most common form is localized granuloma annulare, which is characterized by the presence of small, firm red or yellow colored bumps (nodules or papules) that appear arranged in a ring on the skin. In most cases, the sizes of the lesions range from one to five centimeters. The most commonly affected sites include the feet, hands, and fingers. In addition to the localized form, there are four less common forms: generalized or disseminated, linear, perforating, and subcutaneous. The lesions associated with granuloma annulare usually disappear without treatment (spontaneous remission). However, the lesions often reappear. The exact cause of granuloma annulare is unknown. Granuloma annulare occurs more often in females than males. The disorder can affect people of any age, but occurs most frequently in children and young adults. The prevalence of granuloma annulare in the general population is unknown. Localized granuloma annulare occurs more often than the others forms. In many cases, the eruptions of granuloma annulare disappear without treatment (spontaneous remission). Therefore, many affected individuals do not require specific treatment. However, the episodes of the disorder may recur. Treatments for chronic forms of the disorder include corticosteroid drugs such as dapsone and isotretinoin, which is the synthetic form of retinoic acid (related to vitamin A).
