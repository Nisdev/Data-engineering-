The severity of AGAT varies from patient to patient. People with AGAT typically present with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, delayed speech, and may have seizure activity. Some individuals may develop autistic like behaviors. Children with AGAT may not gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive), and have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting and walking. Affected individuals may also have weak muscle tone and tend to tire easily. Fewer than 20 patients with AGAT have reported worldwide. CCDS patients are frequently misdiagnosed with cerebral palsy as infants and toddlers. Children are often misdiagnosed with autism or global developmental delays.
