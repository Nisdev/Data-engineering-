McCune-Albright syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. Precocious puberty is more common in females. The disorder is estimated to affect 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 individuals in the general population. Because the disorder is difficult to diagnose, affected individuals may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of MAS in the general population.
