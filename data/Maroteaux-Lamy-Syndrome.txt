Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome affects males and females in equal proportion. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is unknown. The prevalence of all forms of MPS is estimated to be from one in 43,261 to one in 1,505,160 births. However, because MPS disorders, especially milder forms, often go unrecognized, these disorders are underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population.
