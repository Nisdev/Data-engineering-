Elephantiasis is a condition characterized by gross enlargement of an area of the body, especially the limbs. Other areas commonly affected include the external genitals. Elephantiasis is caused by obstruction of the lymphatic system, which results in the accumulation of a fluid called lymph in the affected areas. A diagnosis of elephantiasis is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and identification of characteristic symptoms. A variety of tests may be used to determine the underlying cause of lymphatic damage and subsequent elephantiasis.
