Sneddon syndrome is a rare progressive disorder affecting small- and medium-sized blood vessels. The disorder is characterized by the association of a skin condition and neurological abnormalities. Characteristic findings include multiple episodes of reduced blood flow to the brain (cerebral ischemia) causing mini-strokes or stroke and bluish net-like patterns of discoloration on the skin surrounding normal-appearing skin (livedo reticularis). Additional symptoms may include headache, dizziness, abnormally high blood pressure (hypertension), and heart disease. Lesions may develop within the central nervous system as a result of reduced blood flow to the brain, which can cause reduced intellectual ability, memory loss, personality changes, and/or other neurological symptoms. The combination of stroke symptoms and livedo reticularis differentiates this syndrome from other disorders. The exact cause of Sneddon syndrome is not fully understood. Sneddon syndrome has been reported more often in females than in males. Almost 80% of the patients are women with a median age of diagnosis at 40 years. Symptoms usually begin in early to middle adulthood, but can occur at any age including childhood. The incidence and prevalence are unknown. One estimate places the incidence at approximately one out of 250,000 individuals in the general population.
