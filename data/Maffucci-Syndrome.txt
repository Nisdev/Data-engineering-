Maffucci syndrome occurs in all ethnic groups and equally affects both sexes. The diagnosis of Maffucci syndrome is made by a detailed history, thorough physical examination and radiologic assessment. Surgical removal and microscopic study of the skeletal lesions confirm the presence of enchondroma and distinguish the tumor from chondrosarcoma.
