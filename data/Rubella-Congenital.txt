Congenital rubella is a syndrome that occurs when a fetus has been infected with the rubella virus while in the uterus. It is primarily characterized by abnormalities of the heart and nervous system, the eyes and the ears. The fetus is most vulnerable to the virus during the first three months of pregnancy, although pregnant women are advised to avoid exposure to rubella virus at all times. Women who contract rubella during pregnancy have a high risk of having a baby with congenital rubella. Congenital rubella can affect a fetus when a pregnant woman who is not immune to the virus contracts rubella (German Measles).  The baby may also be affected if the mother contracts rubella immediately before conception.  The fetus is most vulnerable during the first three months (first trimester) of a pregnancy.
