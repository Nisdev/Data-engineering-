Femoral-Facial Syndrome is a rare disorder that occurs randomly (sporadically) in the population. There have been, however, two cases reported in which the disorder appeared to be inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. The major symptoms of this disorder are underdeveloped thigh bones (femurs) and unusual facial features. Femoral-Facial Syndrome is a very rare disorder that seems to affect more males than females.  As of  1993, about 55 cases had been reported.  One-third of cases are associated with maternal diabetes.
