Mitochondrial diseases are one of the most common forms of metabolic disease. They are estimated to affect about 1 in 5,000 people in the general population of the United States. Within the mitochondrial diseases, PMM are very common but real epidemiological studies are not available yet. This is also because PMM often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed so determining their true frequency in the general population is difficult. These disorders affect both men and women, children and adults, and individuals of all ethnic and racial groups.
