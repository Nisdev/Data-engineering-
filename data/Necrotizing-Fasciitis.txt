"Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare infection that means ""decaying infection of the fascia,"" which is the soft tissue that is part of the connective tissue system that runs throughout the body. NF is caused by one or more bacteria that attacks the skin, the tissue just beneath the skin (subcutaneous tissue), and the fascia causing these tissues to die (necrosis). These infections can be sudden, vicious, and fast-spreading. If not treated quickly with antibiotics and/or debridement of the infected tissue, the patient may develop toxic shock syndrome or toxic shock-like syndrome, which may lead to multiple organ failure and death. Conditions and behaviors that increase the prevalence of poly-microbial NF include obesity, poorly controlled or untreated diabetes, chronic kidney failure, HIV, alcohol abuse, abscess, IV drug use, blunt or penetrating trauma, insect bites, surgical incisions, indwelling catheters, chicken pox, vesicles, and (rarely) perforation of the gastrointestinal tract (Sarani et al). However, everybody is susceptible to NF."
