Pompe disease occurs in various populations and ethnic groups around the world. Estimates vary, but its incidence is generally placed at approximately 1 in 40,000 births in the United States. Males and females are affected in equal numbers. Not all people with Pompe disease are readily diagnosed. In the past few years, several people with Pompe disease have been identified with screening programs among patients with undiagnosed limb-girdle dystrophies and/or hyper CK-emia of unknown cause (high level of creatine kinase in the blood is often indicative of muscle damage).
