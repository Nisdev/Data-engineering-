Psittacosis is an uncommon infectious disease that is most often transmitted to humans through exposure to infected birds, especially parrots, cockatiels, parakeets and similar pet birds. Psittacosis can affect the lungs and may cause inflammatory illness of the lungs (pneumonia). Additional common symptoms include fever, muscle pain (myalgia), headaches, and a dry cough. The diagnosis of psittacosis is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings and a variety of specialized tests such as specialized blood tests that reveal characteristic antibodies, produced by the body in response to psittacosis infection. Antibodies are specialized proteins produced by the body to fight off foreign material such as bacteria.
