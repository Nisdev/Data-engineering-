Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a rare disorder that affects males twice as often as females. Although it may affect individuals of any age, the disorder most often occurs in middle-aged adults. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is unknown. One estimate places the incidence at approximately 1 person per each 100,000 in the general population in the United States or Europe. Some studies suggest that the incidence of PSC is increasing. PSC is one of the leading reasons people require a liver transplant in the United States. In Nordic countries, PSC is the number one cause for a liver transplant.
