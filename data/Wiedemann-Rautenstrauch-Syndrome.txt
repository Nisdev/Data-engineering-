WRS is an extremely rare genetic disorder that appears to affect males and females relatively equally. WRS has been observed in various ethnic and racial groups. The disorder was initially described as a distinct entity in 1979 (Wiedemann HR) based upon observation of two unrelated individuals as well as previous reports of two affected sisters in 1977 (Rautenstrauch T). More than 35 affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature to date.
