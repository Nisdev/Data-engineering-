The estimated incidence of melorheostosis is 1 in 1,000,000. Both sexes are affected and approximately 400 cases have been reported. In melorheostosis, bone scans appear to be markedly positive. However, on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) there is usually a low signal. X-ray imaging is the preferred diagnostic tool for melorheostosis. X-rays often reveal a pattern of thickened bone (sclerotic bone lesions) that resembles dripping candle wax.
