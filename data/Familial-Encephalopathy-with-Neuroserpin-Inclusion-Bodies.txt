Familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB) is a rare genetic degenerative disorder affecting the brain and spinal cord, or central nervous system (neurodegenerative disorder). Affected individuals display poor attention and concentration, declining work or academic performance, and language difficulties. Eventually, they experience a decline in their intellectual abilities (dementia). Memory, however, is relatively well-preserved early in the course of the disease compared to the severe memory deficits that are typical of Alzheimer's disease. Some affected individuals develop additional symptoms such as uncontrolled, irregular muscle contractions and seizures. Changes in mood, such as apathy, depression, or anger frequently occur. Eventually, affected individuals require comprehensive medical care. FENIB affects males and females in equal numbers. Only a few families with this disorder have been reported in the medical literature. FENIB was originally described in the medical literature in 1999. The incidence of FENIB in the general population is unknown. The age of onset of FENIB can be as early as the first decade or as late as the fifth or sixth.
