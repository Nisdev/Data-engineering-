Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (SEDT; SEDL) is a rare, hereditary skeletal disorder that only affects males. Physical characteristics include moderate short stature (dwarfism), moderate-to-severe spinal deformities, barrel-shaped chest, disproportionately short trunk, and premature osteoarthritis. SEDT does not exhibit any ethnic predisposition. Affected individuals have been described in European, American, Asian, and Australian populations (but not in African-Americans to date). One estimate suggests that the incidence is 2 persons per million.
