Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). The disease may develop due to reactivation of the measles virus or an inappropriate immune response to the measles virus. SSPE usually develops 2 to 10 years after the original viral attack. Initial symptoms may include memory loss, irritability, seizures, involuntary muscle movements, and/or behavioral changes, leading to neurological deterioration. With widespread uss of the measles vaccine in the United States, the incidence of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis has been reduced dramatically, although about 10 cases per year are reported. However, in less developed parts of the world, this disorder is much more common.  In India, for example, the incidence is estimated at about 20 cases per year per million of population.  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis seems to affect males more often than females and occurs far more often in children and adolescents than in adults.
