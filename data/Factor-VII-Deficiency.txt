Factor VII deficiency affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder is estimated to affect 1 in 300,000 to 500,000 individuals in the general population. However, many cases of factor VII deficiency go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population. The incidence of factor VII deficiency tends to be higher in countries where marriage to close relatives (consanguineous marriage) is more common. According to the medical literature, more than 200 cases of true factor VII deficiency have been reported. Because of the variable severity of factor VII deficiency, the age of presentation can vary widely from birth until adulthood.
