Short bowel syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder is usually acquired during life, but in rare cases may be present at birth (congenital). In adults, short bowel syndrome usually results from the surgical removal of a portion of the small intestine. Crohnâ€™s disease is the most frequent cause of surgical removal of the small intestine in adults. In newborns, necrotizing enterocolitis is the most common cause of surgical removal of the small intestines. The exact incidence and prevalence of short bowel syndrome in the general population is unknown.
