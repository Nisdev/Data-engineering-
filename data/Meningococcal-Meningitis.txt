Testing for meningococcal meningitis may include imaging techniques such as CT scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Other testing may include examination of the blood and/or skin. Diagnosis is made by laboratory examination of the cerebrospinal fluid that often reveals the presence of bacterial meningitis.
