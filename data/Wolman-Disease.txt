Wolman disease is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. More than 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature. However, cases may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed making it difficult to determine the disorderâ€™s true frequency in the general population. Wolman disease is named after one of the physicians who first identified the disorder in the medical literature in 1956.
