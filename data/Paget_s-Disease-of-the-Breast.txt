Paget’s disease of the breast is a rare form of breast cancer that almost exclusively affects women. However, there have been rare cases in which the disorder has occurred in men. Paget’s disease of the breast most commonly affects middle-aged individuals, primarily occurring between 50 to 60 years of age, although it has been reported in individuals in their 20s. It is thought to represent less than 5 percent of all breast cancer clinical presentations. The exact prevalence and incidence of Paget’s disease of the breast in the general population is unknown.
