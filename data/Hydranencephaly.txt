Hydranencephaly is a central nervous system disorder characterized by an enlarged head and neurological deficits. The exact cause of Hydranencephaly is not known. This extremely rare form of Hydrocephalus involves the absence of portions of the brain. Results of neurologic examination in newborns may be normal or abnormal. The head usually appears enlarged at birth. Vision impairment, lack of growth and intellectual deficits are symptomatic of this disorder. Hydranencephaly can usually be detected at birth due to an enlarged head. Some infants may appear healthy at birth but may later fail to grow at a normal rate.  Irritability, poor feeding, infantile spasms or seizures,  and spasticity or rigidity of arms and legs are symptomatic of this disorder.  Some affected individuals may experience an exaggeration of muscular reflexes (hyperreflexia) and/or increased muscle tone (hypertonia).  Poor body temperature regulation, vision impairment and mental retardation may also occur. Hydranencephaly is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.
