Werner syndrome is a rare progressive disorder that is characterized by the appearance of unusually accelerated aging (progeria). Although the disorder is typically recognized by the third or fourth decades of life, certain characteristic findings are present beginning during adolescence and early adulthood. Werner syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Since the disorder was originally described in the medical literature in 1904 (O. Werner), more than 800 cases have been reported. The disorderâ€™s frequency has been estimated at one to 20 per one million individuals in the United States. Although certain associated findings are present beginning during childhood, puberty, and young adulthood, the disorder is most frequently recognized in the third or fourth decades of life.
