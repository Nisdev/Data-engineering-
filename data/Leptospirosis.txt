Leptospirosis is an infectious disease that affects humans and animals. It results in a wide range of symptoms, and some people may have no symptoms at all. It is caused by a spiral-shaped bacterium (spirochete). Symptoms include high fever, chills, muscle aches, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and jaundice (yellow skin and eyes). Diagnosis may be made during the early stage of the infection (days 1-7) by culturing the Leptospira bacterium from body fluids. From days 4 through 10, the cerebrospinal fluid is cultured, and after day 10, the patient's urine may be cultured. There are other tests of the blood and immune system that may be performed.
