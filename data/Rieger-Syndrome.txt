Rieger syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by absent or under-developed (hypodontia or partial adontia) teeth, mild craniofacial abnormalities, and various abnormalities of the eye, especially glaucoma. If unaccompanied by other signs and symptoms, the eye abnormalities are referred to as Rieger eye anomalies. Rieger syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in about equal numbers.  The eye defects associated with this disorder can be detected during the first month of life. When the eye defects are not visible, diagnosis may be delayed until early childhood when the eye and dental defects become apparent. The disorder is commonly recognized by the presence of characteristic eye defects. In some cases these are delayed and diagnosis may be deferred until early childhood when the small, conical teeth become apparent.
