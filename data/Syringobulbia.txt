Syringobulbia is a neurological disorder characterized by a fluid-filled cavity (syrinx) within the spinal cord that extends to involve the brainstem (medulla). It usually occurs as a slit-like gap within the lower brainstem that may affect one or more of the cranial nerves, causing facial palsies of various kinds. In addition, sensory and motor nerve pathways may be affected by compression and/or interruption. This disorder is intimately associated with syringomyelia, in which the syrinx is limited to the spinal cord, and to the Chiari I malformation. The cause of Syringobulbia is unknown.  The disorder is usually present from birth. Syringobulbia can affect people of either sex.  It usually is apparent before 30 years of age.  In one study of a pediatric population, the average age of onset of symptoms was just under 15 years of age. The diagnosis of syringobulbia is made by means of neuroimaging, typically magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
