Nager syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence and prevalence in the general population is unknown. Many cases go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population. More than 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Although rare, Nager syndrome is the most common form of acrofacial dysostosis.
