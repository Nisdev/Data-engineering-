Cold urticaria is a chronic, reactive skin disorder. It is probably the most common form of physical urticaria (hives). Major symptoms may include abnormal reddening of the skin (erythema), hives and itching after exposure of the skin to cold temperatures. Cold urticaria affects males and females in equal numbers.  Essential cold urticaria makes up about 1% to 3% of all urticaria cases, and occurs most often among young adults.  Familial cold urticaria is rare.
