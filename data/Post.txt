Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a rare, but well-known complication of solid organ transplants and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. PTLD is related to the Epstein-Barr virus and immunosuppression therapy. People who receive these transplants are treated with drugs that suppress the activity of the immune system. Doctors must suppress the immune system to help the body accept the transplant and avoid rejection. Individuals receive these drugs at the time of the transplant (induction therapy) and must remain on these drugs for the rest of their lives (maintenance therapy). Immunosuppressive therapy leaves patients at a greater risk of developing infections and, in some people, of developing post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of these disorders are extremely important. The incidence and prevalence of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease varies based on the type of transplant and affects about 1%-2% of people who have received a kidney (renal) transplant. Rates are higher in heart and lung transplants. PTLD occurs most often with gastrointestinal and multiorgan transplants. PTLD is the most common cancer affecting people who receive solid organ transplants after squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. In a retrospective multicenter study, the overall incidence of PTLD in people who had hematopoietic stem-cell transplants was reported to be 3.2%
