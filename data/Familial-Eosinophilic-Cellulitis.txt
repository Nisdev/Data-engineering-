Familial eosinophilic cellulitis is a rare skin disorder. It is characterized by raised, red, swollen, and warm areas of skin, in a flame-shaped pattern with associated pain. The exact cause of the disease is unknown. However, bites of spiders, bees, mites, fleas, or ticks (arthropods) are often associated with this skin condition. The exact cause of familial eosinophilic cellulitis is still not known.  Some scientists believe that there may be an autoimmune basis for the disorder.  Autoimmune disorders are caused when the bodyâ€™s natural defenses (antibodies, lymphocytes, etc.), against invading organisms suddenly begin to attack perfectly healthy tissue. Familial eosinophilic cellulitis affects males and females in equal numbers.  The disorder is more often found in adults, but it may strike children as well. Standard treatment of familial eosinophilic cellulitis may consist of administration of steroid drugs. However, the disorder often resolves itself after a number of weeks. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.
