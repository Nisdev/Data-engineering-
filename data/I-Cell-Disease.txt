I-cell disease (mucolipidosis II) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by coarse facial features, skeletal abnormalities and mental retardation. The symptoms of I-cell disease are similar to but more severe than those of Hurler syndrome. The symptoms associated with this disorder typically become obvious during infancy and may include multiple abnormalities of the skull and face and growth delays. I-Cell Disease is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers.  Siblings of affected infants have a 1 in 4 chance of being affected by this disorder.  Approximately 30 cases of I-Cell Disease have been reported in the medical literature.  This disease appears to be more common in Japan than in other countries.
