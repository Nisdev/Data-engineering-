There are 23 pairs of human chromosomes, or a total of 46 chromosomes. Mosaic trisomy 22 is characterized by an extra copy of the chromosome 22 (trisomy) in some of the body cell populations. This could be due to an error during the division of reproductive cells in one of the parents (mitotic nondisjunction) or during cellular division after fertilization (fetal mitosis). The disorder can also occur in association with uniparental disomy, an abnormality in which affected individuals have inherited both copies of a chromosomal pair from one parent, rather than one copy from each parent. The presence of the additional chromosome 22 in some groups of cells is responsible for the symptoms and physical findings of the disorder.
