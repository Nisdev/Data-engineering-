Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome is an extremely rare genetic disorder characterized by severe insulin resistance. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, regulates blood sugar levels by promoting the movement of glucose (a simple sugar) into cells for energy production or into the liver and fat cells for storage. Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature. The exact incidence of Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome is unknown. Because rare disorders like Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome often go unrecognized, these disorders are under-diagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome in the general population.
