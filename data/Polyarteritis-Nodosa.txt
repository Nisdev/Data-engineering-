"Polyarteritis nodosa is a rare multi-system disorder characterized by widespread inflammation, weakening, and damage to small and medium-sized arteries. Blood vessels in any organ or organ system may be affected, including those supplying the kidneys, heart, intestine, nervous system, and/or skeletal muscles. Damage to affected arteries may result in abnormally increased blood pressure (hypertension), ""ballooning"" (aneurysm) of an arterial wall, the formation of blood clots (thrombosis), obstruction of blood supply to certain tissues, and/or tissue damage and loss (necrosis) in certain affected areas.

Joint, muscle, abdominal and testicular pain may occur.  The small and medium-sized arteries of the kidneys are most often involved.  The lungs are much less commonly affected. Polyarteritis nodosa usually affects people between 40 and 50 years of age, but it may occur in any age group.  It affects approximately 1 in 100,000 people. Men appear to be affected two to three times more often than women. Since there are no blood or other chemical tests to indicate the presence of this disorder, the diagnosis is based upon physical examination and the exclusion of other likely candidates for diagnosis. In suspected cases, biopsy of the blood vessel wall (lumen) is necessary to confirm the presence of the typical lesions. Biopsies of the kidney or liver may also be required."
