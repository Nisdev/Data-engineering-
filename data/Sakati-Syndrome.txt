"Sakati syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that belongs to a group of rare genetic disorders known as ""Acrocephalopolysyndactyly"" (ACPS). All forms of ACPS are characterized by premature closure of the fibrous joints (cranial sutures) between certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis), causing the top of the head to appear pointed (acrocephaly); webbing or fusion (syndactyly) of certain fingers or toes (digits); and/or more than the normal number of digits (polydactyly). In addition, Sakati syndrome, which is also known as ACPS type III, is associated with abnormalities of bones of the legs, structural heart malformations that are present at birth (congenital heart defects), and/or other findings. Sakati syndrome is thought to be caused by a new genetic change (mutation) that occurs randomly for unknown reasons (sporadically). This mutation is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Sakati syndrome is named after the researcher (N. Sakati) who, along with colleagues, originally described the condition in 1971.  They reported the disease entity in a single male child of a couple who were of advanced parental age.  This apparently remains the only case reported in the medical literature to date. Sakati syndrome can be detected at birth, based upon a clinical evaluation and identification of characteristic physical findings."
