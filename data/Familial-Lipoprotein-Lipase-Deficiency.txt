Familial LPL deficiency affects males and females in equal numbers. It is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 250,000 people in the general population and has been described in all races. The prevalence is much higher in Quebec, Canada due to a founder effect. A founder effect is when a small isolated population of settlers (founders) expands over several generations leading to a high prevalence of a particular genetic trait.
