3/100,000 people per year are affected by glioblastoma in the United States. The average age of diagnosis is 64 years of age with a slightly higher rate in men than women. Caucasians have the highest rate of glioblastoma diagnoses compared to other ethnic groups such as African-Americans, Asians, and American Indians. It is important to differentiate glioblastoma from other tumors that can affect the brain. These include but are not limited to chordomas, central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas, ependymoma, medulloblastomas, lower grade brain tumors, and other cancers that have spread to the brain from other areas. Other conditions such as stroke, brain abscesses, brain bleeds, and cavernous malformations can be mistaken for glioblastoma and should also be ruled out before a diagnosis is made.
