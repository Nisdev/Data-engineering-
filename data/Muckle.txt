Common symptoms of MWS include recurrent rashes beginning in infancy or early childhood, intermittent fevers, joint pain (usually with no apparent changes in tissue and cartilage), recurrent conjunctivitis (the inflammation of the outer most layer of the eye causing redness, discomfort and discharge from the eye), progressive hearing loss and amyloidosis. Symptoms can be unprecipitated, but can also be triggered by cold exposure as well as stress or exercise. Episodes generally last between 24 to 48 hours. Since MWS is a newly discovered condition, the actual incidence and prevalence of the disease are difficult to determine. Diagnosis of MWS is determined through an evaluation of a patientâ€™s symptoms. Confirmation of the diagnosis is achieved through genetic testing and the identification of a CIAS1/NLRP3 mutation, although not all MWS patients possess a mutation in this gene.
