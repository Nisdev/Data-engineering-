Weil syndrome, a rare infectious disorder, is a severe form of the bacterial infection caused by Leptospira bacteria known as leptospirosis. Weil syndrome is characterized by dysfunction of the kidneys and liver, abnormal enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly), persistent yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, and whites of the eyes (jaundice), and/or alterations in consciousness. In most cases, Weil syndrome occurs among individuals who are exposed to affected animals. Weil syndrome is caused by an infection from the bacteria Leptospira icterohemorrhagiae or other related types of this bacteria (such as L canicola, or L pomona).  The infection is usually transferred to humans through urine or tissue of an infected domestic or wild animal.  The infection enters through a skin abrasion or the mucous membranes. Weil syndrome may occur in people of all ages.  At least 75% of persons infected with this disorder are male.  It can be an occupational disorder striking farmers, veterinarians, or sewer and abattoir workers, but most patients are exposed incidentally during recreational activities. The results of various laboratory tests, including blood and urine tests, assist in the diagnosis.
