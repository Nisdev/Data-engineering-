Glut1 deficiency syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The incidence and prevalence of Glut1 deficiency syndrome in the general population is unknown. Because the disorder may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, determining its true frequency in the general population is difficult. Several hundred cases have been identified and described in the medical literature since 1991.
