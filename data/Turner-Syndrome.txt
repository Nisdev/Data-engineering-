Turner syndrome affects approximately 1 female in 2,000-2,500 live female births. It is estimated that more than 70,000 women and girls in the United States have Turner syndrome. There are no known racial or ethnic factors that influence frequency of the disorder. In some cases, the disorder is diagnosed before birth or shortly after birth. However, mild cases can remain undiagnosed until later in life and even during adulthood.
