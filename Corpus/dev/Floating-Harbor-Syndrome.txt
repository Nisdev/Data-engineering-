Floating-Harbor syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is unknown. Because cases may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining the true frequency of FHS in the general population is difficult. As of 2014, approximately 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature. However, some of these individuals do not fit the classical description of FHS and were found not to carry mutations in the SRCAP gene.
