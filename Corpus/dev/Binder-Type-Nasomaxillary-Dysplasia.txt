Binder type nasomaxillary dysplasia is a rare congenital condition that affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence or prevalence is unknown. One estimate suggests that Binder syndrome occurs in less than 1 per 10,000 live births. However, individuals may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.
