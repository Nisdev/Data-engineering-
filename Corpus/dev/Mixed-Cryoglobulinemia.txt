Mixed cryoglobulinemia is believed to be a rare disorder, but the exact incidence and prevalence in the general population is unknown. Less than 1% of HCV-infected patients in Northern Europe and North America develop cryoglobulinemia while 2-5% of HCV-infected patients in South Europe develop the disorder. Mixed cryoglobulinemia most often presents in individuals between the ages of 40-60. Females are affected three times as often as males. Approximately 90% of cases of mixed cryoglobulinemia are associated with infection with the hepatitis C virus.
