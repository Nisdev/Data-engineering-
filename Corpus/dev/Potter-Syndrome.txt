Potter syndrome is a rare disorder, and the exact incidence or prevalence is unknown. The main cause of this condition, bilateral renal agenesis, occurs in approximately 1 in 5,000 fetuses and accounts for about 20% of Potter syndrome cases. The incidence or prevalence of other causes are unknown. Overall, estimates for the incidence or prevalence of Potter syndrome range from 1 in 4,000 to 10,000 births. A couple studies have shown that male newborns are affected more often than female newborns, probably due to the obstructive uropathy that is seen more often in males.
