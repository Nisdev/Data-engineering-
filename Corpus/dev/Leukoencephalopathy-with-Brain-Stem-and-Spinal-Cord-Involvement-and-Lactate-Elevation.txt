LBSL is an extremely rare disorder that was first reported in the medical literature in 2002. According to the nonprofit organization, A Cure for Ellie, as of April 2018, there are about 100 individuals worldwide who have been identified with the disorder. Because rare diseases like LBSL often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, it is difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.
