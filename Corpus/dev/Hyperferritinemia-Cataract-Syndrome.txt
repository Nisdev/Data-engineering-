Hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. More than 100 families with the disorder have been described in the medical literature. The prevalence of hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome has been estimated at 1 in 200,000 people in the general population. Because the disorder is so rare, it often goes unrecognized or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the disorderâ€™s true frequency in the general population. Hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome was first described in the medical literature in 1995. A diagnosis of hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms (e.g., cataracts), a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests such as blood tests, which can reveal elevated levels of ferritin in the blood plasma.
