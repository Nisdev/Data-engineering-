Deafness may be a presenting symptom or may be found on a routine hearing test. Since prenatal ultrasound is now a routine, congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract may be the presenting finding.

So far, about 180 patients have been reported from various countries including the United States, Japan, India, China, Europe and the Middle East. There is equal prevalence across ethnic groups, genders and ages of diagnosis. Clinical awareness of this syndrome will probably increase the number of patients diagnosed.
