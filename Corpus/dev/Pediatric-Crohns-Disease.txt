Crohn’s disease is a common disorder, affecting as many as 780,000 people in the United States. The disorder is most common in individuals between 15-35, with approximately 25% diagnosed by age 20. There is another increase in frequency among individuals between 60-80 years of age. The frequency of pediatric Crohn’s disease is increasing; in particular, there has been a recent increase in the incidence of Crohn’s disease in children less than 6 years old; this is called very early onset (VEO) inflammatory bowel disease. Although more women are affected by Crohn’s disease than men, pediatric Crohn’s disease is more common in boys than girls. Pediatric Crohn’s disease is more common in Caucasians than in people of African descent. It is rare in people of Asian and Hispanic descent. Generally, Crohn’s disease is more severe among children and adolescents than in adults.
