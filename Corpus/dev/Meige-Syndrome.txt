Meige syndrome is a rare neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary and often forceful contractions of the muscles of the jaw and tongue (oromandibular dystonia) and involuntary muscle spasms and contractions of the muscles around the eyes (blepharospasm). The specific symptoms and their severity vary from case to case. Meige syndrome affects women more often than men. Symptoms typically begin in middle-age between 40-70 years, although cases have been reported in individuals much younger. The disorder was first described in detail in the medical literature in 1910 by French neurologist Henry Meige. No tests exist to diagnose Meige syndrome. A diagnosis is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and identification of characteristic symptoms.
