Enterobiasis or pinworm infection is a common, contagious, parasitic infestation found mainly in children. The disorder is spread by swallowing or inhaling the tiny eggs of the pinworm. Enterobiasis rarely causes any serious physical problems except for the main symptom, which is severe rectal itching.
