Congenital heart block is characterized by interference with the transfer of the electrical nerve impulses (conduction) that regulate the normal, rhythmic, pumping action of the heart muscle (heart block). The severity of such conduction abnormalities varies among affected individuals. Congenital heart block is a rare disorder that appears to affect males and females in equal numbers.  The incidence of complete congenital heart block is one in approximately 20,000 to 25,000 live births.
