Lamellar ichthyosis is a rare genetic skin disorder. In lamellar ichthyosis, the skin cells are produced at a normal rate, but they do not separate normally at the surface of the outermost layer of skin (stratum corneum) and are not shed as quickly as they should be. The result of this retention is the formation of scale. Lamellar ichthyosis is a very rare disorder occurring in less than one in 200,000 people.  Lamellar ichthyosis is not limited by gender, race or ethnicity; it occurs in all populations. Lamellar ichthyosis is treated topically with skin barrier repair formulas containing ceramides or cholesterol, moisturizers with petrolatum or lanolin, and mild keratolytics (products containing alpha-hydroxy acids.. Severe lamellar ichthyosis can be treated systemically with oral synthetic retinoids. Retinoids are only used in severe cases of lamellar ichthyosis due to their known bone toxicity and other complications.
