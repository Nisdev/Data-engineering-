Fewer than 100 cases of MVID have been reported in the medical literature. The true prevalence of this disorder is unknown. Most cases become apparent soon after birth, but it is also believed by some that there is a later-onset form that becomes apparent six to eight weeks after birth in infants that, until then, have appeared healthy. MVID affects more females than males with a sex ratio of about 2:1. The diagnosis of MVID may be based upon electron microscopy of a tissue sample (biopsy) from the intestine of an ailing child, which depicts microscopic findings of brush border defects in the villus in association with microvillus inclusions (MIs) usually in villus enterocytes characteristic of the disorder. Genetic testing is available and can confirm the diagnosis. Before a biopsy is performed, other causes of dehydration and diarrhea in infants are ruled out.
