Miller syndrome is a rare disorder with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 case per 1 million newborns. Because cases may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, determining the true frequency in the general population is difficult. Fewer than 75 cases have been described in the medical literature. Males and females are affected in equal numbers.
