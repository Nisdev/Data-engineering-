HS affects 1 in 2,000 people in North America. It also occurs in other regions of the world, although not as well studied. No genetic changes that are more common in certain groups of people (founder mutations) have been reported. HS affects males and females equally. Age at diagnosis of HS is often between 3 â€“ 7 years but can occur in infancy with severe disease or into adulthood with mild disease.
