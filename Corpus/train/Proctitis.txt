Proctitis is a chronic inflammatory disease arising in the rectum and characterized by bloody diarrhea.  There are two types of proctitis, ulcerative and gonorrheal, which are differentiated by the means in which they are contracted. Gonorrheal proctitis is transmitted through sexual contact. Proctitis is increasing in incidence.  Gonococcal Proctitis is most frequently found in women and homosexual men who practice anal-receptive intercourse. Diagnosis of proctitis is made when sigmoidoscopy reveals inflammation of the mucus lining of the rectum with a clearly demarcated upper border above which the lining is normal. The remainder of the colon and small intestine is found to be normal by barium x-rays, while colonoscopy and rectal biopsy may show changes which are indistinguishable from those of chronic ulcerative colitis. (For more information on chronic ulcerative colitis, see the related disorder section of this report.)
