The mitral valve is the valve between the left upper and left lower chambers (left atrium and left ventricle) of the heart. Mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVP) is a common condition in which one or both of the flaps (cusps) of the mitral valve bulge or collapse backward (prolapse) into the left atrium during ventricular contraction (systole). In some cases, this may allow leakage or the backward flow of blood from the left ventricle back into the left atrium (mitral regurgitation). Although mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVP) has been reported in individuals of various ages, it is most commonly noted in young adults.  Estimates indicate that MVP affects approximately four to eight percent of young adults in the general population, with females affected more commonly than males. As noted above, mitral valve prolapse syndrome may occur as an isolated condition or in association with various underlying disorders or syndromes.  For further information, please see the “Causes” section above or use the disease name in question as your search term in the Rare Disease Database. Mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVP) may be diagnosed based upon thorough clinical examination, a complete patient and family history, and various tests. The condition is often recognized through use of a stethoscope during routine physical examination, based upon detection of a characteristic clicking sound or sounds (systolic clicks) and/or a subsequent, delayed, high-pitched murmur (late systolic regurgitation murmur). The diagnosis may be confirmed based upon specialized imaging techniques, particularly echocardiography, during which sound waves are directed toward the heart, enabling physicians to identify abnormal positioning and prolapse of the mitral valve flaps. In some cases, additional cardiac and other diagnostic studies may be recommended to help confirm and assess the severity of potentially associated abnormalities, such as accompanying regurgitation.
