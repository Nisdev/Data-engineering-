Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS) refers to three rare disorders that many clinicians believe to be intimately related to one another and which represent the range of severity of the same disorder. These disorders are apparent at birth (congenital). As the name suggests, they involve malformations of the eyes, ears and spine. OAVS affects males more frequently than females by an approximate 3:2 ratio.  There is some disagreement in the medical literature concerning the disorderâ€™s rate of occurrence.  Reported estimates range from one in 3000 to 5000 live births up to one in 25,000-40,000 live births.  Most of the physical characteristics associated with OAVS are apparent at birth (congenital), with the possible exception of facial asymmetry, which may not become apparent until approximately four years of age in many cases.
