Uveitis is a general term that refers to inflammation of the part of the eye known as the uvea. Posterior uveitis occurs as an isolated condition or as part of other disease affecting body systems (systemic).  This condition affects males and females in equal numbers.  It can strike at almost any age, although it appears most often to occur between the ages of 20 and 50.  According to one estimate, chronic, non-infectious posterior uveitis affects 175,000 people in the United States and 800,000 people worldwide.  Almost 80% of cases of uveitis affect the front (anterior) portion of the eye. The first step in diagnosis is to determine the role, if any, of other immunological and/or infectious conditions in the development of the disorder. Blood studies for infectious agents such as herpes virus, toxoplasmosis, toxocariasis and spirochetes are helpful. Chest x-rays may detect sarcoidosis or tuberculosis. If systemic or central nervous system involvement is present or large cell lymphoma is suspected, neuroimaging studies and lumbar puncture may be used.
