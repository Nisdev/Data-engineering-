Tooth agenesis is a condition in which teeth are missing. Anodontia is a genetic disorder defined as the absence of all teeth. It usually occurs as part of a syndrome that includes other abnormalities.  Also rare but more common than anodontia are hypodontia and oligodontia. Hypodontia is genetic in origin and usually involves the absence of from 1 to 5 teeth. Oligodontia is genetic as well and is the term used to describe a condition in which six or more teeth are missing. The prevalence of anodontia is unknown. This condition affects males and females in equal numbers. The prevalence of hypodontia is 2 to 8% of the general population (excluding third molar) and oligodontia is 0.09%. to 0.3%.
