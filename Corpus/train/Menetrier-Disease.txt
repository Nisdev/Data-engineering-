Menetrier disease is a rare disorder characterized by massive overgrowth of mucous cells (foveola) in the mucous membrane lining the stomach, resulting in large gastric folds. The most common symptom associated with Menetrier disease is pain in the upper middle region of the stomach (epigastric pain). The cause of Menetrier disease is unknown. Menetrier disease affects males slightly more often than females. It most often affects adults in their 50s or older. However, a childhood form of the disorder exists. Because of the confusion in the literature regarding the term Menetrier disease, it is difficult to determine its true frequency in the general population. Menetrier disease may be suspected in individuals with large gastric folds. Large gastric folds may be diagnosed by a radiologic study after the patient drinks a barium solution or by an endoscopic exam, a procedure in which a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) is inserted through the mouth and used to examine the interior of the stomach and, if necessary, to obtain tissue samples for microscopic study (biopsy). Histopathologic study of affected stomach tissue obtained by biopsy can support a diagnosis of Menetrier disease. Histopathology is the study of microscopic anatomical changes in diseased tissue.
