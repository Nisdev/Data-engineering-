Eosinophilic fasciitis affects both sexes. Some reports suggest that women are affected with greater frequency than men. The disorder can occur at any age (with age at diagnosis ranging from 1-88), but most often occurs in individuals between 30-60 years of age. It occurs with greater frequency in Caucasians. Approximately 300 cases have been reported in the medical literature.
