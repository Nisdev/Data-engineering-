Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by severe periorbital headaches, along with decreased and painful eye movements (ophthalmoplegia). Symptoms usually affect only one eye (unilateral). In most cases, affected individuals experience intense sharp pain and decreased eye movements. Symptoms often will subside without intervention (spontaneous remission) and may recur without a distinct pattern (randomly). Affected individuals may exhibit signs of paralysis (palsy) of certain cranial nerves such as drooping of the upper eyelid (ptosis), double vision (diplopia), large pupil, and facial numbness. The affected eye often abnormally protrudes (proptosis). The exact cause of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is not known, but the disorder is thought to be associated with inflammation of specific areas behind the eye (cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure). While the exact cause of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is unknown, one theory is an abnormal autoimmune response linked with an inflammation in a specific area behind the eye (cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure). In some cases, inflammation may be due to a clumping of a certain type of cell (granulomatous inflammation). Autoimmune disorders are caused when the body’s natural defenses against “foreign” or invading organisms (e.g., antibodies) begin to attack healthy tissue for unknown reasons. Other possible causes may include generalized inflammation and constricted or inflamed cranial blood vessels. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare neuro-immunological disorder that occurs in males and females in equal numbers. The average age of onset is 41 years, but there have been cases reported among people younger than age 30. In rare cases, children under the age of 10 have been diagnosed with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome.
