The exact incidence of macrocephaly-capillary malformation is unknown. Since its first description as a distinct entity in 1997, more than 140 affected individuals have been reported. Some patients may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed making it difficult to determine the true frequency of MCAP in the general population. Males and females appear to be affected in equal numbers.
