Keratosis follicularis affects males and females in equal numbers. It is estimated to occur in 1 in 36,000 to 100,000 individuals in the general population. The disorder usually becomes apparent during the second decade in life, but has developed in individuals as young 4 and older than 70. Keratosis follicularis was first described in the medical literature in 1889. A diagnosis of keratosis follicularis is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings and microscopic examination (biopsy) of affected skin tissue. A biopsy may reveal abnormal formation of keratin tissue (keratinization) and failure of cell-to-cell adhesion (acantholysis).
