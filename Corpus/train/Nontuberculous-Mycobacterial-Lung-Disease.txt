In North America, the incidence of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease is rising, particularly among the elderly. Generally, NTM infection is more common in Caucasians, Asians and individuals with a compromised immune system. The incidence and prevalence rates reported in the medical literature varies and because many cases may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed determining the true frequency of NTM infections in the general population is difficult.
