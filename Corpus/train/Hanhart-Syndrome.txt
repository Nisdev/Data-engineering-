Hanhart syndrome is a very rare developmental disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Fewer than 1 in 20,000 children are affected with this disorder. Approximately 30 cases of Hanhart syndrome were reported in the medical literature from 1932 to 1991. Hanhart syndrome is detected in the neonate (newborn), based upon a thorough clinical evaluation and characteristic physical findings. Signs of Hanhart syndrome may be identified before birth (prenatally) by ultrasonography, a test that creates an image of the fetus by measuring the reflection of sound waves.
