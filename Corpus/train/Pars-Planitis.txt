Although pars planitis is generally benign, there can be significant vision loss in extreme cases. It is an immunological disorder of the eye characterized by inflammation of a part of the uvea, the layer of tissue between the sclera and the retina, the membranes protecting the eyeball. The uvea, in turn, is made up of three portions: the iris, the ciliary body, and the choroid. In addition, the uvea contains many of the blood vessels that supply the eye. Pars planitis is an uncommon ocular disorder of children and young adults that affects males slightly more frequently than females. Pars planitis is usually diagnosed by means of a thorough physical evaluation, detailed patient history, and specialized eye examination.
