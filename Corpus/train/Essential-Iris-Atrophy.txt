Essential iris atrophy is a very rare, progressive disorder of the eye characterized by a pupil that is out of place and/or distorted areas of degeneration on the iris (atrophy), and/or holes in the iris. This disorder most frequently affects only one eye (unilateral) and develops slowly over time. Attachment of portions of the iris to the cornea (peripheral anterior synechiae) and subsequent closure of the drainage angle may lead to secondary glaucoma and vision loss. Essential iris atrophy is a very rare disorder that predominantly affects females in the middle adult years. The prevalence is not known.
