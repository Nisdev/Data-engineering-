Papillon-Lef√®vre syndrome is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers and is found in all ethnic groups. More than 200 cases have been reported in the medical literature. In the general population, the disorder occurs in approximately one to four individuals per million. However, determining the incidence or prevalence of rare disorder is extremely difficult. Skin abnormalities associated with this disorder may be present at birth (congenital) or by the age of five. Other symptoms usually become apparent between the third and fifth year of life.
