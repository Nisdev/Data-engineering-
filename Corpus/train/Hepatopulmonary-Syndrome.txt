Portopulmonary hypertension is another vascular complication of liver disease, which is often confused with HPS. However, hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension are not the same disease. Although both are abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature resulting from liver disease, HPS is characterized by vasodilatation and hypoxemia whereas portopulmonary hypertension is characterized by obstruction or narrowing (vasoconstriction) of blood vessels with resulting pulmonary arterial hypertension6.
