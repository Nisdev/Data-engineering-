Wilms’ tumor is a type of kidney cancer that occurs in young children. It is responsible for 95% of all malignant kidney tumors in patients under the age of 15 years old. Wilms’ tumor can occur in one kidney (unilateral) or in both kidneys (bilateral) and can spread throughout the rest of the body. There are about 650 new cases diagnosed each year in the United States with the average age of diagnosis being 2 to 5 years of age. Wilms’ tumor is the most common pediatric kidney cancer, and the fourth most common pediatric cancer overall. Wilms’ tumor affects approximately 1 in 10,000 children with the median age of onset being 3.5 years. Girls are slightly more likely than boys to develop Wilms’ tumor and African Americans are also at a higher risk.
