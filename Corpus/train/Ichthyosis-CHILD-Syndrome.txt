CHILD syndrome (an acronym for congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform erythroderma and limb defects) is an inherited disorder, affecting primarily women, that is characterized by ichthyosis-like skin abnormalities and limb defects on one side of the body. Other abnormalities may be present, as well. Only about 30 cases have been reported in the United States and of these 29 involved infant girls and only 1 involved a boy.   Of these 30 cases, only 6 cases involved organs or systems on the left side of the body. A thorough physical exam may be sufficient for the diagnosis.
