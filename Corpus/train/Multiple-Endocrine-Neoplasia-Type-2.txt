Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by an increased risk of developing a specific form of thyroid cancer (medullary thyroid carcinoma) and benign tumors affecting additional glands of the endocrine system. The endocrine system is the network of glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream where they travel to various areas of the body. These hormones regulate the chemical processes (metabolism) that influence the function of various organs and activities within the body. Hormones are involved in numerous vital processes including regulating heart rate, body temperature and blood pressure. Glands affected in MEN2 may secrete excessive amounts of hormones into the bloodstream, which can result in a variety of symptoms. MEN2 affects males and females in equal numbers. It has been estimated to affect 1 in 30,000 people in the general population. Some researchers believe that many cases of MEN2 go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the disorderâ€™s true frequency in the general population. MEN2A is the most common subtype accounting for more than 80 percent of cases. MEN2B is the least common accounting for approximately 10 percent of cases. All cases of medullary thyroid carcinoma (i.e., both those are associated with MEN2 and those are not) account for approximately 5-10 percent of thyroid cancers.
