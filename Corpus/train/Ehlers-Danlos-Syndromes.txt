Signs and symptoms of EDS may become apparent during childhood. However, depending upon the form and severity, age of diagnosis varies widely. Reported estimates for the incidence of all EDS types range from 1/ 2,500 to 1/5,000 births. hEDS is estimated to affect 1/10,000-1/15,0000. cEDS is estimated to affect 1/20,000-1/40,0000. Because those with mild joint and skin manifestations may not seek medical attention they remain undiagnosed and it is difficult to determine the true frequency of EDS mutations in the general population. hEDS, clEDS, and vEDS are most common subtypes. Other subtypes (kEDS, aEDS, and dEDS) are much less common. Only about 60 individuals with kEDS have been identified. Only about 30 patients with aEDS have been reported. Only about 12 patients of dEDS have been described. Some named variants of EDS (e.g. X type or dysfibronectinemic type) have only been identified and reported in single individuals within one affected family.
