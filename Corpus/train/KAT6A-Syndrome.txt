KAT6A syndrome is believed to affect females and males in equal numbers. The exact number of people who have this disorder is unknown. According to the KAT6A Foundation, as of October 2018, there are 150 individuals known to have the disorder. Rare disorders like KAT6A syndrome often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population. KAT6A syndrome is underdiagnosed and one estimate suggests that the disorder may account for as much as 1% of undiagnosed individuals with syndromic developmental delay.
