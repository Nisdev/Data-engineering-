The juvenile form of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis affects males and females in equal numbers. The adult form affects males slightly more often than females. In the United States, the incidence of RRP was previously estimated to be approximately 2 per 100,000 adults and 4 per 100,000 children with approximately 1,000 new pediatric cases in the United States each year. With the increased uptake of the HPV vaccine, these numbers are dropping precipitously.  In children, JORRP is most often diagnosed between the ages of 2-4. In adults, the disorder occurs most often in the third or fourth decade though a second peak around age 60 has recently been noted. A variety of conditions can produce signs and symptoms that are similar to those seen in RRP. Such conditions include asthma, allergies, chronic bronchitis, croup, vocal nodules, and gastroesophageal reflux. Comparisons may be useful for a differential diagnosis.
