Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome is a rare disorder affecting males and females in equal numbers. The disorder occurs worldwide. KTS is diagnosed based on physical signs and symptoms. Computed axial tomography (CAT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and color doppler studies may be useful in determining the extent of the condition and how best to manage it.
