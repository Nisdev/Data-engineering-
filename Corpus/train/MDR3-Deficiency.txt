MDR3 deficiency affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence and prevalence of MDR3 deficiency is unknown. Concerning PFIC3, fewer than 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Because milder forms of MDR3 deficiency often go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, it is difficult to determine the disorderâ€™s true frequency in the general population.
