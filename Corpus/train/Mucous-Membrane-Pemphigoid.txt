Mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) is a group of rare chronic autoimmune disorders characterized by blistering lesions that primarily affect the various mucous membranes of the body. The mucous membranes of the mouth and eyes are most often affected. The mucous membranes of the nose, throat, genitalia, and anus may also be affected. The symptoms of MMP vary among affected individuals depending upon the specific site(s) involved and the progression of the disease. Blistering lesions eventually heal, sometimes with scarring. Progressive scarring may potentially lead to serious complications affecting the eyes and throat. In some cases, blistering lesions also form on the skin, especially in the head and neck area. The exact cause of MMP is unknown. Mucous membrane pemphigoid is a rare group of autoimmune blistering disorders that affects females twice as often as males. The average age of onset of MMP is during the seventh decade (60 to 70 years of age). However, the disorder can occur at any age. The exact incidence of MMP is unknown. Because the disorder is difficult to identify, many researchers believe it is under-diagnosed. A diagnosis of MMP is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings and certain tests known as a biopsy and direct immunofluorescence. For a biopsy, a small sample of skin tissue is removed (biopsy) and microscopically examined. For direct immunofluorescence, a second biopsied skin sample is tested to detect the presence of the specific autoantibodies (e.g., IgA, IgG, and C3) that cause pemphigoid.
