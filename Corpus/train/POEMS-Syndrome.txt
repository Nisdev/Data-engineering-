POEMS syndrome affects men more often than women and usually occurs during the forties or fifties, although it has been reported in individuals in their twenties. The disorder was originally thought to be more common in Japan than in the United States and Europe. POEMS syndrome often goes unrecognized, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.
