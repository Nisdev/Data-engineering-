A diagnosis of trichotillomania may be suspected if characteristic symptoms are present such as patches of hair loss. A diagnosis may be made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history and a variety of tests that can rule out other causes of hair loss. Because many individuals may be reluctant to talk about hair pulling behavior due to shame/embarrassment, a diagnosis can often be overlooked.
