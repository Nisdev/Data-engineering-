NAGS deficiency is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. In most cases, onset of symptoms occurs at, or shortly following, birth. The estimated frequency of urea cycle disorders collectively is one in 30,000 births. However, because urea cycle disorders like NAGS deficiency often go unrecognized, these disorders are under-diagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of urea cycle disorders in the general population.
