Scapuloperoneal myopathy is a rare genetic disorder characterized by weakness and wasting of certain muscles. Symptoms are usually limited to the shoulder blade area (scapula) and the smaller of the two leg muscle groups below the knee (peroneal). Facial muscles may be affected in a few cases. The leg symptoms often appear before the shoulder muscles become weakened. The rate of progression of the disorder varies from case to case. This condition can also occur in combination with other disorders. Scapuloperoneal myopathy is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Scapuloperoneal myopathy affects males and females in equal numbers. Symptoms may begin in childhood or during adulthood. Scapuloperoneal myopathy is a rare disorder; the exact prevalence of this disorder in the general population is unknown.
