DM1 is estimated to affect about 1 in 8,000-20,000 people in the general population. However, the prevalence of DM1 and DM2 vary greatly among different countries and different ethnic groups. The incidence of DM2 is higher in Germany and Finland. Because some people with DM may go unrecognized or undiagnosed, determining the true frequency of these disorders in the general population is difficult. Researchers have determined that DM is the most common form of adult onset muscular dystrophy.
