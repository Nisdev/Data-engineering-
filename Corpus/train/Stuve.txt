STWS has a very low prevalence of <1 out of 1,000,000. However, the disease is relatively common in the United Arab Emirates with a prevalence of 1 out of 20,000 births, owing to the fact that parents are often closely related by blood (consanguineous). STWS affects males and females in equal numbers. Patients with STWS often go unrecognized making it difficult to determine the true frequency of the disorder in the general population. STWS was first described in the medical literature in 1971.
