Fibrolamellar carcinoma is a rare form of cancer that affects the liver. Unlike most cancers of the liver, it occurs with greater frequency in adolescents and young adults who are otherwise healthy. There are often no symptoms or signs of the disorder for a long time. Symptoms that can develop include abdominal pain, unintended weight loss, and a general feeling of poor health (malaise). Treatment is usually through surgical removal (resection) of the tumor. When surgery is not possible or is unsuccessful, then other therapies may be considered. Recurrence following successful surgical removal of a tumor can occur, meaning that sometimes the tumor can come back after it was removed. The exact, underlying cause of this disorder is unknown. Fibrolamellar carcinoma is an ultra rare form of cancer. It affects both men and women and affects approximately 1 in 5,000,000 people in the general population.  Fibrolamellar carcinoma occurs with greater frequency among young adults with a median age of diagnosis of 25. It is found all over the world and the rate of occurrence can vary geographically. The disorder accounts for about 1% of all people with primary liver cancer in the United States, but accounts for about 5.8 percent of all people with primary liver cancer in Mexico.
