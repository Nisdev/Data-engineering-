Some type of EB occurs in an estimated 1 out of every 50,000 live births. The disorder occurs in every racial and ethnic group throughout the world and affects both sexes equally. Any blistering disorder in the newborn period may mimic EB. These include herpes simplex virus, epidermolytic ichthyosis, bullous impetigo and incontinentia pigmenti. Clinical diagnosis of the type of EB based on presentation in the neonatal period should be avoided as all types of EB may look alike in this age group. When EB is suspected, a skin biopsy should be obtained and sent to an appropriate laboratory to confirm the diagnosis with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and/or immunofluorescent antibody/antigen mapping. Molecular genetic testing for mutations in most of the genes known to be associated with the various types of EB is clinically available.
