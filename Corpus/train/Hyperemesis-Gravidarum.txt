The diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, and the identification of characteristic symptoms (e.g., persistent and severe nausea and vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss). The diagnosis is one of exclusion as other causes of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy must be ruled out. Physicians should determine the frequency of nausea and vomiting and the extent to which they affect an affected individualâ€™s daily life.
