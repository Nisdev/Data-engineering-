A diagnosis of PNH may be suspected in individuals who have symptoms of intravascular hemolysis (e.g., hemoglobinuria, abnormally high serum LDH concentration) with no known cause. A diagnosis may be made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests. The main diagnostic test for individuals with suspected PNH is flow cytometry, a blood test that can identify PNH cells (blood cells that are missing GPI-anchored proteins).
