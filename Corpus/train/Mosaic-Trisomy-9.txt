"Mosaic trisomy 9 is a rare chromosomal disorder in which the entire 9th chromosome appears three times (trisomy) rather than twice in some cells of the body. The term ""mosaic"" indicates that some cells contain the extra chromosome 9, while others have the typical chromosomal pair. Mosaic Trisomy 9 may be caused by errors during the division of a parent's egg or sperm or during the division of body tissue cells (somatic cells) early in the development of the fetus. Mosaic trisomy 9 appears to affect males and females of all ethnicities in relatively equal numbers. Since the disorder was originally described in 1973 (Haslam RH), over 55 cases have been reported in the medical literature."
