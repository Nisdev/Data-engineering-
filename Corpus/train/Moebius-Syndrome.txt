Moebius syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The disorder is present at birth (congenital). The exact incidence and prevalence rates of Moebius syndrome are unknown. One estimate places the incidence at 1 case per 50,000 live births in the United States. A diagnosis of Moebius syndrome is based upon the characteristic signs/symptoms, a detailed patient history, and a thorough clinical evaluation. There are no diagnostic tests that confirm a diagnosis of Moebius syndrome. Some specialized tests may be performed to rule out other causes of facial palsy.
