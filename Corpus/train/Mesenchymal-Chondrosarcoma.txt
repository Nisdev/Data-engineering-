Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma was first described in the medical literature in 1959. It is an extremely rare form of cancer; fewer than 800 cancers have been reported in the medical literature. This tumor is most common in children and young adults (aged 10-30), but can affect individuals of any age including young children and older adults. Females are affected slightly more often than males. Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is more likely to occur outside the bone in young adults or children and to affect bone in older adults. Mesenchymal chondrosarcomas account for approximately 5-10 percent of all cases of chondrosarcoma.
