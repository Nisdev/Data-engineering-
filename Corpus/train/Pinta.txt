Pinta is a rare infectious tropical disease affecting the skin that is caused by the bacterium Treponema carateum, which is transmitted by direct, nonsexual contact. Pinta progresses through three distinct stages, which are characterized by various skin lesions and discoloration. Other organ systems are not affected. Exposed areas of the skin such as the face and extremities are most often affected. Pinta is an infectious tropical disease caused by the spiral-shaped bacterium (spirochete) known as Treponema carateum. A diagnosis of pinta is suspected based upon a detailed patient history (e.g., recent travel to endemic area), a thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic symptoms, and a variety of tests. These tests may include the microscopic examination of tissue samples (darkfield examination) from the skin lesions of affected individuals. Other blood tests (e.g., VDRL and Treponemal antibody absorption test [FTA-ABS]) usually become positive only after the secondary skin lesions appear.
