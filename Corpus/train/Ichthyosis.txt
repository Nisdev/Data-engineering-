Ichthyosis is a general term for a family of rare genetic skin diseases characterized by dry, thickened, scaling skin. The various forms are distinguished from one another by: 1) extent of the scaling and how widely and where the scaling is scattered over the body; 2) the presence or absence and intensity of reddening of the skin (erythroderma); 3) the mode of inheritance; and 4) the character of associated abnormalities. All the ichthyoses are rare disorders.  Incidences vary according to disease type.  The ichthyoses occur in all populations.  Most forms are not bounded by gender, race or ethnicity.
