Syringomyelia most commonly presents in young adults between 20 and 40 years of age, but can also develop in young children or older adults. Some reports suggest that syringomyelia is slightly more common in males than females. One estimate places the incidence at 8.4 individuals per 100,000 in the general population in the United States.
