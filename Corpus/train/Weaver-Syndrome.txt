Weaver Syndrome is a rare disorder affecting males three times more often than females. The syndrome is usually present before birth (prenatal onset). Treatment of Weaver Syndrome is symptomatic and supportive. An orthopedist can be consulted for correction of foot deformities. Genetic counseling may be of benefit to patients and their families.
