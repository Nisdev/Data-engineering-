"Marshall-Smith Syndrome is characterized by unusually quick physical growth and bone development (maturation), usually starting before birth. Other symptoms can include respiratory difficulties, mental retardation, and certain physical characteristics. (Note: Marshall-Smith Syndrome is not to be confused with ""Marshall"" Syndrome, which is very different from ""Marshall-Smith"" Syndrome.) The exact cause of Marshall-Smith Syndrome is unknown.  There is no evidence that it is genetic. Marshall-Smith Syndrome is a rare disorder present at birth affecting males and females in equal numbers.  Symptoms of the syndrome are usually present before birth (prenatal onset). Treatment of Marshall-Smith Syndrome is symptomatic and supportive. Aggressive treatment of breathing (respiratory) difficulties is necessary. Special education and related services will be necessary during school years."
