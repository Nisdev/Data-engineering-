Factor X deficiency affects both men and women and can occur in individuals of any ethnic or racial group. The disorder is estimated to affect about 1 in every 500,000-1,000,000 people in the general population. Rare disorders like factor X deficiency often go unrecognized or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.
