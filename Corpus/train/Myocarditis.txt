Myocarditis is a rare cause of many common clinical symptoms. For example chest pain and shortness of breath with activity can result from many forms of heart disease and non-cardiac causes. Because the diagnostic tests for cardiac inflammation, magnetic resonance imaging or heart biopsy, are not widely available, the diagnosis is often overlooked. In people who have autoimmune disorders, myocarditis may result from an autoimmune reaction against heart tissues and not a viral infection. In this setting, myocarditis is a part of a more widespread process that may require treatment with medication to suppress the immune system.Â  Myocarditis can also exacerbate the cardiac damage from other rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis.
