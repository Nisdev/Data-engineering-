Short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic defect in fatty acid catabolism belonging to a group of diseases known as fatty acid oxidation disorders (FOD). It occurs because of a deficiency of the short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) enzyme. SCAD deficiency is thought to affect 1 in 40,000 to 100,000 newborns. In the US, ~10% of individuals have two copies of one of the common polymorphisms leading to potential identification of related metabolites in urine or blood.
