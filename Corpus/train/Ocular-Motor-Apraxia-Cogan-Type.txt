Cogan type ocular motor apraxia affects males approximately twice as often as females.  Symptoms are present at birth (congenital).  The jerking-head movements associated with this disorder usually appear by the third or fourth month of life.  Approximately 50 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Diagnosis of Cogan type ocular motor apraxia may be made upon observing the jerking-head movements that an infant will make in order to view an object to the side. Infants who exhibit jerking-head movements and the inability to fixate on an object should have a thorough eye examination by a qualified physician. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), CT Scan, or Positron Emission Tomography (PET) may be used to determine whether any associated brain abnormalities (i.e., underdevelopment of the corpus callosum or improper development of the cerebellar vermis) are present.
