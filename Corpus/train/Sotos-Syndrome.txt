Sotos syndrome is a genetic disorder, described in 1964, characterized by excessive growth before and after birth, a large, elongated (dolichocephalic) head, distinctive facial configuration, and a non-progressive neurological disorder with intellectual disability. Advanced bone age is present in approximately 75 to 85% of patients. Sotos syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers, occurs in all ethnic groups and has been detected throughout the world. This condition occurs in about one in 14,000 live births.
