Primary visual agnosia is an extremely rare neurological disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. The first detailed account of visual agnosia in the medical literature occurred in 1890. A variety of psychophysical tests can be conducted to pinpoint the nature of the visual process that is disrupted in an individual. Brain damage that causes visual agnosia may be identified through imaging techniques, including computed tomography (CT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
