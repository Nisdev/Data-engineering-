The diagnosis of meningioma is mostly based on a patient history and physical examination, medical imaging, and analysis of the cells composing the tumor. A patient that has signs and symptoms suggestive of a central nervous system lesion such as recent onset of seizures or neurological deficits (for more details, see the “Signs & Symptoms” section) will usually undergo brain and/or spine medical imaging with a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is the imaging modality of choice for initial evaluation of brain tumors. Although the presence of a meningioma can be suspected with medical imaging due to their characteristic location, analysis of the cells of the tumor provides the most definitive diagnosis. Meningioma cells can be obtained by removing a piece of the tumor with a biopsy. However, meningiomas are usually removed surgically without a prior biopsy as this provides therapeutic in addition to diagnostic benefit. Once tumor cells are obtained, they can be observed under the microscope by a pathologist, who will confirm the diagnosis. A laboratory technique called immunohistochemistry can be used to stain meningioma cells to facilitate their identification.
