Ménière's Disease is a disorder characterized by recurrent prostrating dizziness (vertigo), possible hearing loss and ringing sounds (tinnitus). It is associated with dilation of the membranous labyrinth (endolymphatic hydrops) in the ear. The onset of Ménière’s Disease most commonly occurs during the fifth decade of life.  However, in some cases, symptoms may become apparent during young adulthood or in elderly individuals.  The disease appears to affect males and females equally.
