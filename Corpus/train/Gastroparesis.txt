Gastroparesis (abbreviated as GP) represents a clinical syndrome characterized by sluggish emptying of solid food (and more rarely, liquid nutrients) from the stomach, which causes persistent digestive symptoms especially nausea and primarily affects young to middle-aged women, but is also known to affect younger children and males. Diagnosis is made based upon a radiographic gastric emptying test. Diabetics and those acquiring gastroparesis for unknown (or, idiopathic) causes represent the two largest groups of gastroparetic patients; however, numerous etiologies (both rare and common) can lead to a gastroparesis syndrome. Gastroparesis demonstrates a gender bias affecting more women than men. Approximately 80% of idiopathic cases are women. Idiopathic gastroparesis may be linked to an as yet-to-be-elucidated enteric autoimmune disease. The prevalence of delayed gastric emptying in Type 1 diabetics has been reported to be 50% and in type 2 diabetics, reports range from 30% to 50%. Post surgical gastroparesis is a recognized as inadvertent vagal nerve damage or entrapment following upper abdominal surgery, examples are: fundoplication for the treatment of GERD, bariatric surgery, peptic ulcer surgery, anterior approach for spinal surgery (scoliosis), heart, lung transplant, or pancreatic surgery. A stomach motor disturbance known as “dumping syndrome” whereby food or liquids empty too quickly from the stomach can present with similar symptoms as are found in gastroparesis. Other disorders that may clinically present as gastroparesis (gastritis, gastric ulcers, pyloric stenosis, celiac disease, and GI obstructions) need to be ruled out.
