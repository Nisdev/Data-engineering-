Hispanics have a higher incidence of diffuse LCH involvement and Blacks are less affected. (Riberio) The overall incidence of LCH is between 4 and 9 cases per million with males slightly more affected than females (1.2:1) and the highest number of cases presenting in the first four years of life. The diagnostic work-up may include X-rays of the skull, a complete skeletal bone survey and PET scan, chest x-ray, complete blood count and differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, liver function tests including AST, ALT, bilirubin, and albumin; electrolytes and urinalysis. (Phillips) CT of the skull if mastoids involved. Pulmonary disease: high resolution CT. Brain: MRI. Diabetes insipidus: water deprivation test or serum and urine osmolality.
